Create a modern industrial banner for a project named "Convoy".

Text:
- Only the English word "Convoy" (exactly). No other words.
- No Japanese/Chinese/Korean characters.

Theme:
- Inspired by a heroic red/blue “command truck” vibe, but keep it generic.
- Suggest a truck front abstractly using shapes: grille grid, headlight rectangles, windshield-like panels.
- Add subtle road/lane or motion cues to imply a convoy in motion.
- Clean, modern, tech-industrial style; readable and not busy.

Colors & typography:
- Palette: red + blue accents with metallic/silver neutrals and dark charcoal text.
- Sans-serif, medium to bold weight, crisp letter spacing.

Avoid:
- Any recognizable Transformers/Optimus Prime depiction.
- Any robot face/helmet silhouette, franchise logos, insignias, or trademarked iconography.
- Traditional Japanese luxury motifs (wagara, gold leaf, ornate decoration).

Composition:
- Centered title with generous padding.
- Keep important elements inside the middle band so it remains readable after 16:9 cropping.
