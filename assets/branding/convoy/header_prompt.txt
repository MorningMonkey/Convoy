Create a wide banner background for a project named "CONVOY".
IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any text, letters, words, logos, watermarks, or typography in the image.
The title will be added later by a separate script.

Style:
- Mission Control / industrial / high-readability background
- Abstract “command truck” front vibe using generic shapes (grille grid, headlight rectangles, windshield-like panels)
- Subtle grid / circuit traces / HUD lines, but keep it clean and not busy
- Symmetric composition, centered focal point, large safe empty area in the middle for later title overlay

Colors:
- Dark charcoal / metallic silver neutrals
- Controlled red + blue accents (thin highlights)
- No gold accents

Avoid:
- Any robot face/helmet silhouette
- Any recognizable Transformers/Optimus Prime depiction
- Any franchise-like insignias, emblems, or trademarked iconography
- Heavy rust / distressed frame border / grunge vignette

Output:
- 16:9 wide banner, suitable for cropping to a centered strip
- High contrast, clean edges, no clutter
